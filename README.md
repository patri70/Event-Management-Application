# Event Management Application

## Description
This is a desktop application designed to help users manage events easily. It allows both administrators and regular users to interact with a list of events.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide a clean and functional interface for event planning, developed as part of a 2nd-year University project.

## Features
- **Admin Mode**: Add, delete, and update events.
- **User Mode**: Browse events, add them to a personal list, and export the list.
- **Undo & Redo**: Easily reverse or repeat your actions (using buttons or `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`).
- **Table View**: A modern way to see all events in a clear table format.
- **File Support**: Data is saved automatically to files (`.txt`, `.csv`, or `.html`).

## How to Run
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
2. Make sure you have the **Qt framework** installed and configured.
3. Build and run the `a10.sln` solution.
